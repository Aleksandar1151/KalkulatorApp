## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Windows OS**
- **Visual Studio** with `.NET desktop development` workload installed

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP.
2. Open `KalkulatorApp.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution (`Ctrl+Shift+B`).
4. Run the project (`F5`) or execute the generated `.exe` from `bin/Debug`.

### Example
When you press the number buttons followed by an operator and another number, then press `=`, the result will be displayed in the text box.

## Possible Improvements
